/**
 * Binds a `GridPlatform` instance to the React lifecycle:
 *   - Constructs once per MarketsGrid instance. Shared across renders.
 *   - Subscribes to the store and bumps a tick so `columnDefs` / `gridOptions`
 *     re-run the transform pipeline on state changes.
 *   - Fires `platform.destroy()` on REAL unmount only (via grid-pre-destroyed
 *     + a ref-counted effect teardown that ignores StrictMode double-unmounts).
 *
 * Module-level state lives INSIDE the platform instance, so StrictMode
 * double-mounts can't corrupt anything — each platform has its own
 * `resources` / `eventBus`.
 *
 * WHY we don't destroy on useEffect cleanup: React 19 StrictMode fires a
 * synthetic unmount + remount on every mount. If the cleanup destroyed the
 * platform, the second mount would create a fresh platform whose ApiHub
 * never receives the api (AG-Grid's onGridReady was captured by the first
 * handleGridReady closure, which targets the DESTROYED platform). Keeping
 * the same platform across simulated mounts preserves the api attachment.
 * The real teardown happens in `onGridPreDestroyed` below — that fires
 * exactly once on the true grid destroy.
